Here's the simplest implementation of a JavaScript slider I've come across. It's now my default choice of sliders when I need something simple. It's built with the lightweight Swipe slider and some of my own code:

* Pagination that generates the right number of dots based on what's in the slider, supports clicking
* Stops sliding when you hover over
* Some CSS
